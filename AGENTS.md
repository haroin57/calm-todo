# Agent Permissions Policy

These instructions apply to Codex, Claude, and any other assistant operating in this repository.

## File Operations
- Deleting files or directories (e.g., `rm`, `del`, `git rm`, or removing folders) always requires explicit user approval before execution.
- Modifying file contents (creating new files, editing existing files, overwriting, or applying patches) always requires explicit user approval before execution.

## Safe Operations
- Read-only actions (listing files, searching text, reading file contents) do not require approval.
